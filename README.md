# golangCrypto

This program is like a basic metamask that runs and interacted through terminal locally. Strictly for testing purposes.
It supports functionalities like create wallet, check wallet balance, transfer eth between wallets, etc. Once you run the program
you can choose specific function by entering certain commands on terminal.
It interacts with only testnet sepolia network currently. 
There is a main-account with some balance. If you run out of balance in main account then let me know.

This program is written completely in golang and uses go-ethereum related packages. You can just clone it locally and run the main.go
file.
